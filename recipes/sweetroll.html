        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Sweetrolls</strong>, sometimes spelled as Sweet Rolls, are a confectionery food in <strong>The Elder Scrolls</strong> series, starting in the first game, The Elder Scrolls: Arena. They are pastries with a light brown sweetbread as the lower part, with icing covering the top. Sweetrolls are typically made from milk, flour, butter, eggs, and salt. In Skyrim they resemble a Gugelhopf cake. Crisp and crunchy on the outside, moist and soft on the inside, this is a truly legendary treat!</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: This recipe calls for real vanilla for a taste that will send you to Sovengarde, but if you don’t have that on hand, 1 tsp vanilla extract is fine too. The icing is also quite a conservative amount- just enough to glaze the top. If you want a dripping sweetroll experience, you can double the amount.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Jazbay grapes are found on rocky terrain or near hot springs throughout Skyrim. Their rich flavour is so prized that in olden times, permission was required from the Emperor to pick them. While they are no longer banned to the common folk, gathering jazbay is tiresome as they are still rare. If you manage to get your hands on some though, this delicious crostata is perfect for regenerating your magicka (and it tastes amazing too)!</p>

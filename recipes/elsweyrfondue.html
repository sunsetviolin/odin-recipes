        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Elsweyr Fondue</strong> a delicious and hearty dish popular in Skyrim. Nothing quite beats gathering with friends and family around the fondue pot, sharing the simple joy of warm cheese and fresh bread. Elsweyr fondue is unique in that it utilises <strong>three ingredients: ale, moon sugar, and an Eidar cheese wheel</strong>. As such, the cheesy flavour is made more complex with the use of blue Eidar cheese, as well as the warm bitterness of ale and a hint of sweetness from the moon sugar.</p>
